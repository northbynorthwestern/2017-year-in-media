From every sector of society – Hollywood, Capitol Hill and Silicon Valley, to name a few – women stepped forward to shared their stories of sexual assault, tired of silently managing the abuse.</p>",
			"story": "<p>It began with the #MeToo campaign, which took <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/me-too-facebook-hashtag-why-when-meaning-sexual-harassment-rape-stories-explained-a8005936.html\">social media by storm</a>. Though the campaign <a href=\"https://metoomvmt.org/\">began in 2006</a> as a way to help women of color in low-income communities find a way to heal through sexual assault, it took the main stage when the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/11/22/weinstein-aftermath-all-men-accused-sexual-misconduct/884778001/\">allegations against Harvey Weinstein broke</a>, and actress Alyssa Milano tweeted out about her experience with sexual assault. </p><p>Milano’s tweet opened the floodgates for women to begin posting #MeToo all over social media, whether with a story to accompany it or as a stand alone post. Prominent women like Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift and Uber engineer Susan Fowler began replying to the thread, all with their own versions of #MeToo.</p><p>The magnitude of women (and men! See: <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/12/10/569682236/terry-crews-on-his-sexual-assault-lawsuit-this-is-about-accountability\">Terry Crews</a>) who posted to social media brought more attention to the problem of sexual assault than ever before. Since October alone, <a href=\"https://www.teenvogue.com/story/sexual-harassment-assault-allegations-hollywood-music-entertainment\">dozens of influential men</a> have faced sexual assault charges – much to the dismay of the world. Called the <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/pages/interactives/life/the-harvey-weinstein-effect/\">Weinstein effect</a>, men in politics, Hollywood and the tech industry were forced to address their actions, as list upon list of men who had sexually harassed women came out on large news sites like <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/25/us/list-of-accused-after-weinstein-scandal-trnd/index.html\">CNN</a>, <i><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/10/us/men-accused-sexual-misconduct-weinstein.html\">The New York Times</a></i> and <i><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/powerful-men-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-after-harvey-weinstein-list-2017-10\">Business Insider</a></i>. </p><p>On Dec. 6, <i>Time</i> awarded its Person of the Year to the amorphous <a href=\"http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-2017-silence-breakers/\">Silence Breakers</a> – the collective of women who spoke out against sexual assault, helping to expose the damaging power dynamics that allow men to harass women free of charge. Almost everyday since October, new allegations of sexual assault (still) continue to break, forcing everyone to confront the severity of sexual assault in the workplace and everyday life. Though many continue to sympathize with some named aggressors – Louis C.K., Kevin Spacey, Ed Westwick – there is now a larger conversation around rape culture and how it affects the lives of survivors, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/13/16637250/sexual-harassment-abuse-art-legacy\">what it means when we prop up aggressors</a> in media. </p><p>According to the official #MeToo campaign site, <a href=\"https://metoomvmt.org/\">17,700,00 women</a> have reported sexual assault since 1998. But the public has not confronted this truth until the push of #MeToo on social media this year. Perhaps it took the election of the president to push these stories to the forefront of the national conversation, or perhaps women were just tired of carrying the burden alone. Needless to say, #MeToo has done more than give women a place to heal – it has given women a space to speak out against their aggressors and to push back against the silence, giving voice for both men and women to fight against the norm of acceptance surrounding sexual assault.</p>"

I mean, no one really <i>knew</i> Princess Diana – not personally, at least – but she was as much a part of my mother’s life, and I suppose the lives of many others, as family was. So when she died, my mother grieved. And she harbored a long resentment of the Queen and Prince Charles for what had happened to the People’s Princess, from the divorce to her death; as it happens, my mother had embraced her as one of her own.</p>",
			"story": "<p>So naturally, my mother – and a lot of mothers – extended their motherliness towards Diana’s sons. Prince William got married, and my mother remarked on Kate Middleton’s beauty and, inevitably, her wish that Diana could have been there to see it; and this November, when Clarence House, the official residence of Prince Charles, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClarenceHouse/status/935085955383427072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesun.co.uk%2Ffabulous%2F5008069%2Fmeghan-markle-prince-harry-engagement-wedding-announced-buckingham-palace%2F\">announced</a> Prince Harry’s engagement to actress Meghan Markle, she beamed and said, “It’s the last one!” as if the last of her own two children were finally married.</p> <p>So where do I fit into this? I wasn’t born yet when Princess Diana died, and I was a little too young and in the closet to care very much about the first royal wedding I was really exposed to. And I guess as a result I’ve spent much of my life not really caring about the royal family in that sense. But this particular engagement is different, especially as a Northwestern student; she’s one of us. She’s a humanitarian, an international studies double major, a Kappa, a Black woman, an actress and drop-dead gorgeous – and she’s one of us.</p><p>And maybe that’s why I suddenly love her so much. She’s the second coming of the People’s Princess, which – yes, I know, I’m a gay man waxing dramatic about a goddamn princess. The cliché is truly outstanding. But still. Partly because I think everyone wants to be at least a little bit royal, and partly because she’s a Wildcat who’s done some really cool shit in her life, I’m proud to say she’s one of us. </p><p>And we’re, like, totally the first school in the country to have a princess as an alum.</p>"

			"story": "<p>Questions of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials arose beginning in early 2016. The alleged first contact between the Trump camp and Russia was made by <a href=\"http://theappalachianonline.com/2017/11/16/papadopoulos-ties-trump-campaign-russia/\">George Papadopoulos</a>, a young campaign adviser who met with a London-based professor offering a connection with Russian officials. Papadopoulos suggested he could coordinate a meeting between Trump and top Russian officials several times, and was arrested in July by FBI agents investigating the case. He pleaded guilty in October of this year.</p><p>In July 2016, President Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/12/06/donald-trump-jr-s-meeting-with-russian-lawyer-what-to-know.html\">arranged a meeting</a> between a Russian lawyer and Trump staff Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort at the recommendation of a publicist who has ties to both Russia and Trump. Those involved in the meeting maintain that they primarily discussed adoption policies, although many are skeptical of the real basis for the gathering. This meeting and what was discussed there is at the root of the ongoing investigation.</p><p>The investigation into the possibility of collusion between Trump and Russia is headed by special counsel Robert Mueller. In July 2016, FBI director James Comey came on board, granting Mueller access to all past FBI findings in connection to the Russia scandal. In May, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/us/politics/james-comey-fired-fbi.html\">fired</a> Comey, citing his handling of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s use of personal emails. In a dramatic testimony to Congress, however, Comey said that Trump had demanded a statement of loyalty from him, which he refused to give, possibly prompting his sacking.</p><p>Also removed from the investigation was Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself in March. During his first testimony to Congress in October, Sessions <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-testimony-senate-judiciary-committee-hearing/2017/10/17/bf7ab576-b2b2-11e7-be94-fabb0f1e9ffb_story.html?utm_term=.a4fb03f380df\">claimed to forget</a> a meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and lied about having communicated with Russian officials during the campaign.</p> <p>Mueller’s investigation also led to the prosecution of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. In December, Flynn <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40709270\">pleaded guilty</a> to making “false, fictitious and fraudulent statements” to the FBI about the nature of his private meeting with Ambassador Kislyak. He served a short tenure as part of the Trump cabinet and was removed after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about the same meeting.</p><p>As Mueller continues to probe into this increasingly complex situation, more actors and events may emerge to explain the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/11/27/16670950/trump-russia-timeline\">remaining mysteries</a> of the Trump-Russia saga. 2017 was marked with notable developments, and it’s likely that more prosecutions and discoveries will continue to plague the Trump administration moving into 2018.</p><p>For a full timeline of events, check out Vox’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/11/27/16670950/trump-russia-timeline\">visual guide</a> and BBC’s description of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40709270\">main players.</a> </p>"

In May, the world saw the first female-led superhero film in more than a decade, <i>Wonder Woman</i>. The movie, directed by Patty Jenkins and critically acclaimed for its refreshing story and charismatic main character, now tops <a href=\"https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/50-best-superhero-movies-of-all-time/5/\">Rotten Tomatoes' list</a> of the 50 best superhero movies of all time. As if that wasn't enough to stop (false) claims that <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/2015/05/marvel-ceo-doesnt-believe-in-female-superheroes-203801/\">female superhero movies aren't worth the shot,</a> it also quickly became the highest-grossing superhero origin film ever, earning $412.5 million in North America and over $820 million at the worldwide box-office. Princess Diana of Themyscira can surely break many things with her superhuman strength, but I bet she had no idea that <i>records</i> would be some of them, with great help from a female director who treats her as she deserves.</p><p>If that wasn't enough,<i> Lady Bird</i>, the directorial debut of Greta Gerwig, was another delightful surprise. In November, the coming-of-age story <a href=\"https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/lady-bird-just-broke-a-rotten-tomatoes-record-heres-what-greta-gerwig-has-to-say-about-that/\">broke a record</a> that previously belonged to <i>Toy Story 2</i> and became the movie with the most consecutive positive reviews and zero negative reviews against it – which means that it had a perfect 100 percent score from nearly 200 critics until some guy gave it a B- score, lowering it to 99. It has so far won many important awards, such as Best Film by the New York Film Critics Circle, and received four Golden Globes nominations. At this rate, </i>Lady Bird now flies toward some Oscar nominations, pun completely intended.</p><p>Our stories, either fictional or real, are being told. On January 7, actresses will be wearing black at the Golden Globes to protest against any form of abuse in Hollywood. From speaking out about sexual harassment to directing critically acclaimed movies, women have made a big impact by refusing to give in to a sexist industry and showing what we can do. The fact that these two female-led and female-directed films have woman and lady in their names might be a coincidence, but it's also a message: <i>We can tell our own stories, Hollywood, and they will be more interesting and successful than you think</i>. </p>"

I ran a marathon that way senior year, listening to Golic and Greenberg talk about baseball rumors I can’t remember and basketball news I couldn’t fathom caring about for at least 13 of the 26.2 miles. </p>",
			"story": "<p><i>Mike & Mike</i> had its detractors. It was never the most edgy show, or the most incisive  –  probably not even the most insightful or entertaining. For this reason, its support was always strongest in middle-America, away from the cluttered and vitriolic media markets along the coasts and in Chicago. They were two guys talking sports, calmly, plainly, with no curses and plenty of empathy. A show parents could turn on with their kids. A show a kid could throw on whenever.</p> <p>And maybe that’s why <i>Mike & Mike</i> became more than just a show but a national pulse, a constant and steady voice through nearly two decades of turmoils: 9/11, war in Afghanistan, war in Iraq, Katrina, devastating recession, the stagnant recovery, shootings, shootings, shootings, Sandy. Through it all, the Mikes broadcast a simple reminder: There is a world beyond this, at once frivolous and crucial, that beats on. “We hope we can provide a distraction,” Greenberg often said on the mornings he had to double as the 6 a.m. deliverer of tragic news.</p> <p>Over time, for reasons that seem to me less clear, it became a pulse for me. When I was a freshman here, anxious, alone, and afraid to hear myself think, I turned to their voices. I listened to entire shows walking across campus.</p> <p>At 10 a.m. EST on Nov. 17, those two voices signed off for the last time together. For college students, at least those like myself, it wasn’t just a standalone goodbye, but one of a gradual sloughing off of the old voices, those pulses that gave the rhythm of the America we grew up in: Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Stuart Scott.</p> <p>Those pulses have faded. America, as it does, is finding new currents. Our parents had Johnny Carson and Walter Cronkite, and their parents had Walter Winchell and Edward Murrow. Who knows what now voice will find rhythm next – and what America it will articulate.</p>"

			"story": "<p>The astronomical event was reportedly the <a href=\"http://www.wtsp.com/news/eclipse/watch-live-follow-the-solar-eclipse-from-coast-to-coast/465904404\">most-watched ever</a>, following estimates that over 100 million people would be viewing it. More than 12 million people live in the path of totality – a line running throughout 14 states across the U.S. – and anywhere from 1 to 7 million were expected to travel to the path to see the moon completely block the sun. The U.S. hadn’t seen a total solar eclipse since 1979, and even that covered far less distance than the one lucky viewers were able to see this year.</p> <p>What was perhaps even more impressive than the eclipse itself were the jokes that spiraled out of control online, from a classic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/parishilton/status/899598907788972032?lang=en\">Paris Hilton tweet</a> to the various <a href=\"http://time.com/4908745/total-solar-eclipse-memes/\">other references</a> that inundated Facebook feeds. Because while the moon blocked out the sun for only two to three minutes, memes are forever.</p> <p>All cynicism about “doing it for the ‘gram” and tired jokes aside, you’ll never forget where you were when you saw the eclipse. I was at Northwestern in the second week of a summer program. Our professors let us out of class early for an extended lunch, and even provided us with eclipse glasses to facilitate our safe viewing. I’ll always remember lying on the lawn behind Norris with newly-made friends, looking up at the sky as hundreds of people gathered outside across campus in little clusters of viewing parties.</p><p>It reminded me that we all can get excited about the same things.

			"lead": "<p>Sometimes, I forget that I was a Linkin Park fan. Songs like “Numb” and “Bleed It Out” went the route of The Fray rather than of Coldplay, with me giving them all up when I got to high school and discovered seemingly cooler music. That’s not to say Linkin Park wasn’t cool – when I first discovered the band’s music, it was everything that I didn’t even yet know I wanted in songs. And while part of that came from Linkin Park slipping hip-hop and electronic sounds into rock, most of it had to do with Chester Bennington’s voice.</p>",
			"story": "<p></center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5qF_qbaWt3Q\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p><p>I got into Linkin Park late. “Numb” wasn’t my song – it was “Waiting For the End,” the single off 2010’s <i>A Thousand Suns</i> that I serendipitously found on the iTunes charts one day. After one listen, it was intoxicating. It was one of the only songs I wanted to listen to (even after I made it my phone alarm and ringtone). Bennington’s vocals held it together: “All I wanna do is trade this life for something new, holding onto what I haven’t got,” he sang-screamed – and I was hooked.</p><p>Since then, I backtracked into Linkin Park’s music: from “In The End,” which I could rap in full, to “Bleed It Out,” which I only listened to privately because it featured some of Bennington’s most intense screams. Like many other young “millennials,” I claimed Linkin Park as my rock band.</p><p>When I heard that Bennington died this summer, in a suicide by hanging at only 41 years old, I hadn’t listened to Linkin Park in a few years. But as I got back into the band’s music, seeing and hearing tributes across the internet, memories of loving it came back. And I realized how much Linkin Park – and Bennington – had meant to me as a music fan. Chester Bennington was one of the first modern rock stars I knew. More importantly, though, he introduced me to a whole new style of music – one that channeled emotions through screams – that led me further toward pop punk and emo.</p><p>The Sunday after Bennington died, I was driving home from my summer job and listening to the weekly emo show on my favorite alternative rock radio station. The host played a special tribute to Bennington, noting that even though Linkin Park isn’t an emo band, Linkin Park music is special to a lot of emo fans because of reasons like what I experienced, with the band pushing people toward emo. “And I’d give it all away, just to have somewhere to go,” Bennington sang through the radio. While I hope he found his somewhere, I know his music showed thousands of fans somewhere to go.</p>"

This narrative is woven into the fabric of countless sports movies. But the story of the 2017 Houston Astros, a team that rode contributions from both stars and former cast-offs, and just four years ago lost 111 games, was compelling in pure baseball terms, with or without the devastation of Hurricane Harvey. That's what made it so special.</p>",
			"story": "<p>After their totally pie-in-the-sky improbable acquisition of Justin Verlander, one of the best starting pitchers of his generation, the rest played out like, well, a movie. The Astros bucked six decades of “close, but no cigar” franchise history, beating the Red Sox and Yankees in two tight series to clinch their second ever World Series berth.</p><p>The movie wasn’t over, but it sure seemed to be winding down about eight innings into Game 2 of the World Series.The Dodgers had cruised to a Game 1 win, and were just three outs from taking a commanding 2-0 series lead to Houston with Kenley Jansen, arguably baseball’s most dominant closer, on the mound. Four homers, two innings and an immeasurable amount of drama-filled moments later, the Astros had secured their first-ever World Series win. Watch how that happened here:</p> <p><center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1WjAK47niE?start=56\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center> </p><p>The Astros and Dodgers split Games 3 and 4, and then played a fifth game. The Astros won this fifth game, but this video, set to dramatic music, is really the only adequate way to rehash that 13-12 spectacle of sport:</p> <p><center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsdC7NJKwR0\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p><p>The teams headed back to L.A. for Game 6 with the Astros up 3-2 and Verlander on the mound. The odds were in their favor, and they, almost predictably, lost. This set up a weirdly smooth-sailing Game 7 in which their starting pitcher set an MLB record for hit batters but didn't give up a run and Charlie Morton, a veteran starter who had never been overpowering prior to 2017, threw upper 90s gas by the Dodgers over four innings of dominant one-run ball to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sj6FZHRAPY\">seal the deal.</a> </p><p>For Astros fans, this was a lot to unpack. Not only did our (surprise! I'm a fan!) team do the one thing we never truly thought possible, but they did so on the heels of a massive disaster in a way that no baseball fan will ever forget. It was almost too good to be true. It still is. It may always be. </p><p>The World Series did not *fix* the damage caused by Harvey, which will take years to rebuild. And sadly, with rising sea levels due to climate change and Houston's flat, sprawling water-trap of a design, this wasn't the first time, and <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/hell-and-high-water/\">definitely won't be the last time</a> a flood wipes out large chunks of the city. But, at risk of drawing false equivalencies and waxing hyperbolic, Houston, like its baseball team this season, is resilient, and is well versed in the art of the rebuild. What the future holds is unclear, but we know this: Houstonians needed a reason to smile, and in spite of all of the work left to be done, the Astros provided that reason. </p><p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go polish off my <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbwW9Kd3648\">#WorldSeriesGrillz</a>.</p><p><i>Harvey was a few months ago, but the rebuild continues.

			"story": "<p><center><img src=\"http://media.northbynorthwestern.com.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/12/27/fontsgraphicc.png\"></center></p><p>We live our daily lives <i>pretending</i> we don’t care about fonts. Meanwhile, we’ve all spent an hour on the Google Docs drop-down menu trying to pick the perfect serif for our final project. We even toss insults toward Comic Sans, which seems to be such an easy target that even the least design-savvy among us can bully it as the PBR of the design industry. It’s 2017. It’s time to admit that fonts are not just strange names to be listed off like sad Medill verb conjugations. It’s time to admit that we are all typographers.</p><p>Similarly, it should come as no surprise that fonts can say things beyond the meaning of the text they represent. In some cases, they can even change the course of history. Let’s rewind and take a look at all the instances in which fonts changed life as we know it. You’re in for one Helvetica of a ride!</p><p><b>#1: Bad typography creates the largest Oscars upset in history</b></p><p>At this point, it’s no surprise that <i>La La Land</i> lost Best Picture to Moonlight due to an embarrassing on-stage mix-up in February. Vox published <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZSe4xVXHhI\">this piece</a> in March discussing how better typography could have saved the entire embarrassing debacle from happening. Instead of listing the specific award at the top, which is the first place people look, the award name is displayed at the bottom. That makes it pretty easy to accidentally substitute the wrong card without even noticing until after you’ve read off the recipient … which <i>might</i> be too late.</p> <p>Hopefully they’ll fix that in the futura.</p><p><b>#2: Gilbert Baker’s death becomes the birth of a rainbow typeface</b></p><p>When <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/creativity/lgbtq-pride-marchers-now-have-their-very-own-font-for-signs/\">Gilbert Baker</a> died on March 31, it meant the end for a global icon of LGBTQ Pride (and creator of that legendary Rainbow Flag). In his honor, NewFest and NYC Pride created a font called Gilbert. It’s cute in black and white, but the cool thing about Gilbert is that it actually shows up in rainbow colors by default. Can you imagine a greater honor than being immortalized with a <i>typeface</i>? This is Arial big deal.</p><p><b>#3: Everyone’s least favorite font suddenly becomes a fashion statement</b></p><p>Ever heard of Cooper Black?

It’s been popping up across shirts from TopShop, Brandy Melville and even NU’s very own Alpha Phi Chapter. And to think I told my third grade science fair group that it wasn’t good enough for our tri-fold...</p><p><b>#4: The Prime Minister of Pakistan is outed by Calibri</b></p><p>As a general rule of thumb, you should always change the default font.

(I don’t know about you, but I screamed about both of them using Olde English Script more than when I heard “I ... don’t ... like your tilted stage.”) Fans will say it’s just another New Era in Taylor Swift graphics.

Honestly, you can’t go wrong when you combine Ryan Gosling with comedy and fonts. Unless, of course, you’re Avatar, who no one can think of anymore without remembering they used a font typically reserved for vegan restaurant menus and expired spa coupons.</p><p>Just like that, SNL did something I’ve been trying to do since high school: It made hating certain fonts <i>cool</i>.
