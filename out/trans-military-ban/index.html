On the same day, he indicated that the Pentagon would develop a study of how to deploy a ban that does “what is best for the military's combat effectiveness.”</p><p>Trump’s tweets regarding his wish to ban transgender people from the military were met with backlash.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4678281/press-conference-trumps-tweet-banning-transgenders-military-service\">During a speech</a> at the Capitol, Mara Keisling, the executive director of the National Center on Transgender Equality, attempted to quantify how the transgender military ban would affect American readiness.</p> <p>“The President of the United States announced this morning that he is ready to blow 15,000 holes in American military readiness. It is an absolute disgrace, it is a shame, it is unpatriotic and it is cowardly,” Keisling said.</p><p>On Oct. 30, District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, found the ban suspect and likely to be unconstitutional.</p><p>In response to the suit brought forth by “current and aspiring service members who are transgender,” the court denied in-part and granted in-part the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction, according to the case’s memorandum opinion.</p> <p>Among other reasons, Judge Kollar-Kotelly cited “the unusual circumstances surrounding the President’s announcement of them,” “the fact that the reasons given for them do not appear to be supported by facts,” and “the recent rejection of those reasons by the military itself” as reasons to support the plaintiffs due process claim.</p> <p>On Nov. 21, 2017, Judge Marvin Garbis <a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4255804/Stone-v-Trump-Memorandum-on-Order-Preliminary.pdf\">issued a ruling</a> against the ban, citing factors like “the cancellation and postponements of surgeries,” “facing the prospect of discharge” and “the inability to move forward with long-term medical plans” to demonstrate “that [transgender members of the military] are already suffering harmful consequences.”</p> <p>On Dec. 11, <a href=\"https://www.apnews.com/ad450a96c6e245668ed96e0f2bb4e145\">the Pentagon announced</a> that transgender recruits would be allowed to enlist in the military starting on Jan. 1. </p></div>
