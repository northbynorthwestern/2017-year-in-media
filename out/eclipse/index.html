        <p class="lead">&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing like a magnificent act of nature to get people outside just long enough to snap a few photos or send a couple live tweets. If you weren’t looking at the sky through those special glasses (&lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/reneemorad/2017/08/21/solar-eclipse-glasses-recalled/#6a658d652b22&quot;&gt;hopefully not recalled ones&lt;/a&gt;) on Aug. 21 to catch a glimpse of the solar eclipse, you probably had a really good reason for being otherwise preoccupied.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
        <div class="articlebody">&lt;p&gt;The astronomical event was reportedly the &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;http://www.wtsp.com/news/eclipse/watch-live-follow-the-solar-eclipse-from-coast-to-coast/465904404&quot;&gt;most-watched ever&lt;/a&gt;, following estimates that over 100 million people would be viewing it. More than 12 million people live in the path of totality – a line running throughout 14 states across the U.S. – and anywhere from 1 to 7 million were expected to travel to the path to see the moon completely block the sun. The U.S. hadn’t seen a total solar eclipse since 1979, and even that covered far less distance than the one lucky viewers were able to see this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What was perhaps even more impressive than the eclipse itself were the jokes that spiraled out of control online, from a classic &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://twitter.com/parishilton/status/899598907788972032?lang&#x3D;en&quot;&gt;Paris Hilton tweet&lt;/a&gt; to the various &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;http://time.com/4908745/total-solar-eclipse-memes/&quot;&gt;other references&lt;/a&gt; that inundated Facebook feeds. Because while the moon blocked out the sun for only two to three minutes, memes are forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All cynicism about “doing it for the ‘gram” and tired jokes aside, you’ll never forget where you were when you saw the eclipse. I was at Northwestern in the second week of a summer program. Our professors let us out of class early for an extended lunch, and even provided us with eclipse glasses to facilitate our safe viewing. I’ll always remember lying on the lawn behind Norris with newly-made friends, looking up at the sky as hundreds of people gathered outside across campus in little clusters of viewing parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reminded me that we all can get excited about the same things. We all can look at the same sky.&lt;/p&gt;</div>
