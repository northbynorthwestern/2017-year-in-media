Few holidays can compare when it comes to polishing time-honored tradition with a glaze of colorful warmth, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlnPHQ3TLX8">Pixar’s <i>Coco</a></i> does just that with the Mexican holiday Día de los muertos.</p></p>

The musical fantasy film traveled far from origins shrouded in controversy. A 2013 attempt by Disney to trademark “Día de los Muertos” as the film’s future name incited <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/3/15/14936576/pixar-coco-the-book-of-life">cries of exploitation</a>, but four years later Pixar has made a turnaround to die for.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/cartoonist-lalo-alcaraz-work-pixars-coco-n413771">Mexican American cartoonist Lalo Alcaraz</a> initially criticized the project, he later joined a cultural consultant group for the film, dedicated to ensuring authenticity. The studio’s dedication to accuracy shines through 12-year-old Miguel Rivera, its first person-of-color lead, as he takes his passion for music from womb to tomb – and beyond.</p><p>Miguel, voiced by Anthony Gonzalez amid a completely Latinx cast, enjoys the simple things: his misadventures with xolo street dog Dante, an unlikely friendship with his bisabuela Coco and a forbidden passion for music. The pursuit of his musical dreams take him on wild ride through the Land of the Dead, where magical realism reigns.</p>

        <p>Rainbow-hued alebrije soar through the screen, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-en-mn-coco-20171206-story.html">bringing with them success</a> from box office to critical reception to public praise. Since its opening on Thanksgiving weekend, <i>Coco</i> won over the box office twice, set to continue the streak. Rotten Tomatoes praises its “rich visual pleasures” with a 96 percent approval rating, and the film strummed music to its audience’s ears.</p><p><center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m glad I watched <a href="https://twitter.com/pixarcoco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@pixarcoco</a> after I was done with finals bc I am going to be emotionally incapacitated until Saturday when I go back home to &amp;#x1f1f2;&amp;#x1f1fd; and rave with all my family about how freaking good this movie is.</p>&amp;mdash; Mariana Alfaro (@marianaa_alfaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/marianaa_alfaro/status/938309705822277633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </center></p><p><i>Coco</i> taps into an emotional catharsis that the American Latinx community, it seems, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com.mx/2017/11/06/20-memes-de-coco-porque-si-no-los-hubieramos-hecho-no-seriamos-mexicanos_a_23268788/">has largely embraced</a>. Though its customs stem from northern Mexico, Pixar’s call and response to a Latinx identity was cause for celebration (and a happy tear or two) for many. Details like matriarchal abuela Elena’s chancla – used to keep mischievous Miguel in line – sail right off the big screen and into audience hearts.</p><p><i>Author’s note: While <i>Coco</i> reviews overall tended toward the positive, some of those in the Mexican Indigenous community found the film <a href="https://twitter.com/arianathepoet/status/935701598055161856">whitewashed and exploitative of their culture</a>. North by Northwestern recognizes and respects these concerns.</i></p></div>
