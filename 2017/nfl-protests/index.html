        <p class="lead"><p>Race and sports in the United States has a long and complicated history, from the <a href="http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/baseballs-jackie-robinson-chosen-one">mass resistance</a> to Jackie Robinson’s entry into Major League Baseball to <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2016/06/07/civil-rights-champion-muhammad-ali-was-anything-but/En45jgnZU2ukPf7GA0IgrL/story.html">criticism</a> of Muhammad Ali’s controversial black separatist ideology to charges of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/14/us/issue-of-racism-erupts-in-simpson-trial.html">racial bias</a> in O.J. Simpson’s 1995 murder trial. However, perhaps the most direct and contentious intersection of race and politics is the ongoing NFL protests. Started by quarterback Colin Kaepernick in <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem">2016</a> and inspired by Black Lives Matter, the movement aims to address racial inequality in America, with a special emphasis on police brutality against Black citizens.</p></p>
        <div class="articlebody"><p>Over <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/10/24/the-nfl-player-protests-broken-down-by-team-and-week/?utm_term=.6e20f5d6f6d4">150 NFL players</a> have followed Kaepernick’s lead by kneeling during the national anthem before games and thousands of celebrities as well as politicians including former President Barack Obama, congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee and congressman Mark Pocan have expressed support for the movement and its goals. On the other side opponents including Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Vice President Mike Pence have cited the protests as disrespectful to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/10/09/politics/donald-trump-mike-pence-nfl/index.html">“our soldiers, our Flag, and our National Anthem.”</a> President Donald Trump has led the resistance movement, demanding that NFL owners <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2017/10/16/donald-trump-nfl-national-anthem-protests-kneeling-hillary-clinton-comments">release players</a> who kneel for the national anthem.</p><p>The national spotlight on the protests has increased amidst a series of violent racially charged events, most notably the “Unite the Right” white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, VA that left three dead. Supporters of the protests <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/09/27/when-nfl-players-protest-racist-some-critics-see-only-millionaire-athletes-who-should-be-silent/?utm_term=.0574a68e7b01">note</a> that backlash against the predominantly Black players is another example in a long list of Black athletes being portrayed as ungrateful to their country, and clearly demonstrates implicit racism. There is no precedent for a president and his administration attacking a major sports industry. The direction of the protests has also shifted as time has passed; they have been used to <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/2017/9/28/16376500/nfl-protests-2017-kneeling-national-anthem-why">fight police brutality</a>, support Black Lives Matter, highlight power dynamics between owners and players, and, most recently, to<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/25/politics/nfl-protests-weekend/index.html"> bolster opposition</a> to Trump.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kaepernick opted out of his contract with the 49ers on March 3 and remains a free agent, despite leading the 49ers to a Super Bowl less than 5 years ago and despite many experts citing him as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/sports/kaepernick-tracker/?utm_term=.1a393d97b61a">better than current starting quarterbacks</a>. Over 40 quarterbacks have signed contracts with teams since Kaepernick became a free agent. Kaepernick has filed a <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/colin-kaepernicks-collusion-grievance-against-nfl-moving-forward/">grievance</a> against the NFL claiming collusion to keep him on the free agent market.</p></div>
