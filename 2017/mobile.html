      I never got to know Princess Diana the way my mother did. I mean, no one really
      <i>knew</i>
      Princess Diana – not personally, at least – but she was as much a part of my mother’s life, and I suppose the lives of many others, as family was. So when she died, my mother grieved. And she harbored a long resentment of the Queen and Prince Charles for what had happened to the People’s Princess, from the divorce to her death; as it happens, my mother had embraced her as one of her own.

      on Dec. 14 the appointment of A.G. Sulzberger as the company’s new publisher beginning on Jan. 1, while his father, Arthur O. Sulzberger, Jr., will step down at the end of the year.

      In 2016, women comprised just
      <a href="http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2016_Celluloid_Ceiling_Report.pdf">7 percent of all directors working on the top 250 domestic grossing films</a>
      . No, not even 20 or 10 percent. Only 7. Considering that we're half of the population, it's impossible not to feel disappointed, even outraged with such a low number. I mean, we just want to live in a world where female characters are properly written and have more to show than their support for the male lead ... Is that too much to ask?

      I found
      <i>Mike & Mike </i>
      when I found running, and I discovered that I simply didn’t know or like enough music to last an hour or more a day, six days a week. It was high school, and the longtime radio program had just started releasing their show as podcast. When the miles grew too long and my mind wavered and my shoulders sagged, I plugged in those two breezy voices to the finish. I ran a marathon that way senior year, listening to Golic and Greenberg talk about baseball rumors I can’t remember and basketball news I couldn’t fathom caring about for at least 13 of the 26.2 miles.

      There’s nothing like a magnificent act of nature to get people outside just long enough to snap a few photos or send a couple live tweets. If you weren’t looking at the sky through those special glasses (

    <p>Sometimes, I forget that I was a Linkin Park fan. Songs like “Numb” and “Bleed It Out” went the route of The Fray rather than of Coldplay, with me giving them all up when I got to high school and discovered seemingly cooler music. That’s not to say Linkin Park wasn’t cool – when I first discovered the band’s music, it was everything that I didn’t even yet know I wanted in songs. And while part of that came from Linkin Park slipping hip-hop and electronic sounds into rock, most of it had to do with Chester Bennington’s voice.</p>

    <p>When a team wins after a traumatic event takes place in its city, it makes everybody feel good. Those people deserved a reason to smile, you might read, and this team gave it to them. This narrative is woven into the fabric of countless sports movies. But the story of the 2017 Houston Astros, a team that rode contributions from both stars and former cast-offs, and just four years ago lost 111 games, was compelling in pure baseball terms, with or without the devastation of Hurricane Harvey. That's what made it so special.</p>
